# JavaScript Simple Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple JavaScript projects I built while learning the language.  
The main goal of these projects is to practice **JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and working with APIs** as preparation for client-side security research and penetration testing (e.g., XSS).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I already had experience with **Java, OOP, and JavaFX**, but wanted to learn JavaScript since it’s essential for:
- Understanding **client-side behavior** in web applications.
- Practicing **DOM interactions** that are directly related to client-side attacks like **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
- Building a foundation for more advanced penetration testing and bug bounty work.

These projects are not meant to be advanced applications, but **hands-on practice** to connect theory with code.

This page lists all projects with descriptions and links:

1. **Calculator**  
   A simple calculator to practice user input, operators, and DOM updates.

2. **Clock**  
   Real-time digital clock using JavaScript `Date`.

3. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   Classic game against the computer using random number generation and conditionals.

4. **Stopwatch**  
   Timer app built with `setInterval` and event handling.

5. **Recipe App**  
   Fetches recipes from an external API to practice **JSON**, **fetch API**, and **asynchronous JavaScript**.
